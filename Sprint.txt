A Library Management System (LMS) is simple, practical project . Lets break it down  in 3 levels.

Level 1: Basic (Beginner-Friendly)
Add new books (title, author, ID, availability)
Mark a book as issued/returned

Level 2: Intermediate
User login/signup (student vs. librarian)
Students can search and issue books
Librarian can add/remove books

Level 3: Advanced
Role-based dashboard (Admin/Librarian/Student)
Fine calculation for late returns
